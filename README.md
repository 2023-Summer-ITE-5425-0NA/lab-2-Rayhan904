# Requirements
# we created tasklist using usestate hook which contains an array of objects

# The count variable is used to calculate the total number of tasks by iterating over the tasklist and summing up the lengths of each task's subtask array.

# The rendered output shows the task count and presents a structured view of the tasks with their titles and subtasks.

# CHALLANGES
# No Challanges faced
